# CodeLens Changelog

All notable changes to CodeLens will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [6.1.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Tauri framework detection**: Detects `tauri.conf.json`, `Tauri.toml`, `src-tauri/` directory, and `@tauri-apps/api`/`@tauri-apps/cli` packages. Handbook identity includes `tauri` label (e.g., `rust-js-tauri-monorepo`). Init config adds `src-tauri/src/` to backend paths.
- **Electron framework detection**: Detects `electron` package and `electron-builder.yml/json` config files.
- **Ask command Tauri/Electron routing**: "is this a tauri app?", "is this an electron app?", "what kind of app?" now correctly route to `detect` instead of `context`.
- **Stop word filtering in ask symbol extraction**: Common English words (is, are, this, app, project, etc.) are no longer treated as symbol names when routing natural language queries.
- **Substring matching in symbols search**: `symbols "epub"` now finds `parse_epub_metadata`, `extract_epub_cover_bytes`, etc. without requiring `--fuzzy` flag. Results sorted by exact match first, then by ref_count.

### Fixed

- **a11y_engine import error**: Removed unused `safe_read_file` import from `a11y_engine.py` that caused `ImportError` on startup.
- **God object false positives in JS/TS**: Previous regex counted ALL `word(` patterns as class methods (10-30x inflation). Now uses brace-depth tracking to scope method counting to actual class bodies. `Class 'on' has 76 methods` and `Class 'is' has 158 methods` false positives eliminated.
- **State map React component false positives**: Components using destructured props `const X = ({` and `forwardRef<T>()` patterns are now correctly skipped. Radix UI primitives (`DropdownMenu`, etc.) and component aliases filtered out. Module-level check prevents indented local variables from being classified as global state. Stores dropped from 129 → 44 on test project.
- **Dead code flags config exports as dead**: Config files (`postcss.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, etc.) and middleware files are now skipped. Common framework entry-point exports (`config`, `middleware`, `withPWA`, `defineConfig`) added to skip list.
- **API map full path for pages/api in monorepos**: Routes like `/apps/readest-app/src/pages/api/kosync` are now correctly shortened to `/api/kosync` in monorepo projects.
- **Ask routing for "is this a X app?" questions**: Previously matched "is" as a symbol name and routed to `context`. Now routes to `detect` correctly.

### Tested

- Test target: [Readest](https://github.com/readest/readest) — open-source ebook reader built with Tauri v2 + React + Next.js (monorepo with 1243 source files, 3709 backend nodes, 26111 edges).
- All 8 bugs identified and fixed. Re-tested on same project after fixes with clean scan.

## [6.0.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Monorepo-aware framework detection**: Detects turborepo, pnpm-workspace, lerna, nx. Walks sub-directory package.json (apps/*, packages/*) to find frameworks in workspace packages. Detects Rust/Cargo workspaces. Build tool detection (Vite, webpack, esbuild).
- **Polyglot project identity**: Handbook detects combined types (e.g., `rust-js-monorepo`) when both package.json and Cargo.toml exist.
- **Dead code from registry cross-reference**: Uses backend registry's `ref_count` data to find functions with zero references.
- **Monorepo-aware config defaults**: `init` now adds `apps/*/`, `packages/*/`, `crates/*/` paths when monorepo detected.

### Fixed
- **God object detection**: Class method counting now scoped to actual class/impl body via brace-depth tracking. Was counting ALL function calls in the file as methods (10-30x inflation).
- **API route false positives**: Routes must start with `/` for non-router objects. Expanded skip list (80+ objects). Prevents `headers.get('user-agent')` from being reported as `GET /user-agent`.
- **CSS specificity false positives**: Tracks brace depth to distinguish CSS rule selectors from property values. Was flagging `rgba()`, `var()`, gradient values as selectors.
- **State map over-classification**: Skips ALL_CAPS constants, React components (arrow functions, forwardRef, memo, styled), and immutable values. Removed module.exports scanning.
- **Entrypoints markdown formatting**: Bracket types like `[main]` no longer get mangled by markdown link reference interpretation.
- **Dead code zero results**: Fixed registry cross-reference to use correct field names (`fn` instead of `name`). Added filtering for main(), pub functions, and test fixtures.
- **Handbook type detection**: No longer defaults to `node-project` for Rust+TS monorepos. Cargo.toml is always checked regardless of existing type.

## [5.6.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **TSX backend extraction**: When tree-sitter-typescript is not installed, TSX files are now parsed with BOTH frontend AND backend fallback parsers. Backend nodes jumped from 124 → 764 (6.2x) on typical Next.js projects.
- **Shared utils module** (`scripts/utils.py`): Centralized `write_output_files`, `compute_summary`, `is_file_path`, `deduplicate_callers`, `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS`, `DEFAULT_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS`, `CODELENS_VERSION`, and `logger`. Eliminates 290+ lines of duplicated code across 5 files.
- **Proper logging**: Replaced silent `except Exception: pass` blocks with `logger.warning()`/`logger.debug()` calls across all engine and utility files. Errors are now visible when they occur instead of being silently swallowed.
- **Fuzzy file path lookup**: `context layout.tsx` and `query layout.tsx` now match partial paths (end-of-path matching). Previously required exact path like `apps/web/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`. Returns grouped results when multiple files match.
- **Auto-incremental scan with registry counts**: When no changes detected, the response now includes actual backend/frontend counts instead of zeros.
- **Handbook registry freshness check**: Handbook skips re-scan if `backend.json` is less than 5 minutes old. Reduces handbook execution time from 2.8s → 0.3s for consecutive runs.

### Changed

- **is_frontend_file / is_backend_file**: Now uses path segment matching instead of substring matching. `"src/"` no longer falsely matches `src/server/api/auth.ts` as a frontend file.
- **_detect_workspace depth limit**: Walks up at most 10 directory levels (was unlimited). Prevents matching a `.git` directory many levels up.
- **Incremental scan with deleted files**: Instead of falling back to full rescan, deleted files are selectively removed from the registry. Preserves incremental scan performance.
- **god_objects Python scoping**: Method count is now scoped to each class using indentation analysis (was counting ALL `def` in the file).
- **Consistent status field**: `context` and `query` file-path responses now include `status: "ok"` (was missing).
- **Context multi-file response**: New `type: "files"` response format when multiple files match a partial path query, with markdown formatting support.
- **Handbook version**: Now uses `CODELENS_VERSION` constant from `utils.py` (was hardcoded as `"5.2.0"`).
- **Centralized `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS`**: All 30 engine/command files now import `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS` from `utils.py` instead of defining local copies. Single source of truth ensures consistency across all scanners.
- **pyproject.toml version**: Aligned with skill.json and CODELENS_VERSION (was 5.1.0, now 5.6.0). Description updated from "39 commands" to "41 commands".

### Fixed

- **TSX files produced zero backend nodes**: When TSXParser failed to import, only CSS class/ID data was extracted. Now uses `parse_js_backend_fallback` on TSX files too.
- **Auto-incremental returned zero counts**: "No changes detected" response had `backend.nodes: 0, backend.edges: 0` even when registry had thousands of entries.
- **Handbook version stale**: Was hardcoded as 5.2.0 in output, now dynamically reads from `CODELENS_VERSION`.
- **Test import errors**: 6 test files (test_cli, test_css_parser, test_html_parser, test_js_backend_parser, test_js_frontend_parser, test_rust_parser) were importing from old monolithic `codelens.py`. Updated to import from the new modular structure (`commands.scan`, `parsers.fallback_*`).
- **Scan edge filter for deleted files**: Edge cleanup was overly permissive — kept ALL unresolved edges regardless of whether they referenced deleted nodes. Now only keeps edges where `from` is in remaining nodes.
- **setup.sh version reference**: Updated from "v2" to "v5" to match current version.
- **CLI test suite**: `__tests__/cli/test_scan.py` now uses hermetic temporary workspaces instead of scanning the host project, and added 3 new test cases (init, scan+query integration, registry creation).

## [5.5.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Auto-incremental scan**: Scan now automatically uses incremental mode when a registry already exists (`.codelens/backend.json` present). No need to pass `--incremental` flag. First scan is always full; subsequent scans auto-detect changes.
- **oRPC route detection**: API-map now detects oRPC-style routers (`.procedure()`, `router({})`, `protectedProcedure`/`adminProcedure` chains). Detects 67 routes in typical oRPC projects (was 2).
- **tRPC v10+ detection**: Improved tRPC extraction with `t.procedure`, `publicProcedure.query/mutation`, `initTRPC`, and router body parsing for named procedure paths.
- **Context by file path**: `context src/lib/auth.ts` now returns all symbols defined in that file, not just symbol-name lookups.
- **Query by file path**: `query src/lib/auth.ts` returns all symbols in the file, grouped by file.
- **bun.lock support**: Vulnerability scanner now parses Bun's text-based `bun.lock` format for dependency checking.
- **Next.js destructured route exports**: API-map now detects `export const { GET, POST } = handler()` and `export const GET = ...` patterns in Next.js App Router.

### Changed

- **Health score calibration**: Deep nesting now reports per-block instead of per-line (was 6419 findings → 300). Magic values skip config/test/fixture files and JSX style props. Weighted density formula (`critical*3 + warning + info*0.1`) prevents info-level smells from tanking scores. Typical React project health: 90 (was 25).
- **Deep nesting thresholds**: Raised from 4→5 (warning) and 6→8 (critical) to account for natural React component nesting.
- **Duplicate caller filtering**: `query` and `context` commands now deduplicate callers by (file, line) tuple.

### Fixed

- **Secrets markdown truncation**: Severity "high" was truncated to "igh]" in markdown output due to f-string variable name collision. Now displays correctly as `[HIGH]`, `[CRITICAL]`, etc.

## [5.4.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **True incremental scan**: Partial registry merge — changed files' entries are updated in-place instead of rebuilding the entire registry. Unchanged files' data is preserved, making `--incremental` significantly faster for large codebases.
- **Complete markdown formatters**: All 41 commands now have specific markdown formatters (was 15/41). No command falls through to generic formatting anymore.
- **Score-based ask routing**: Natural language query router now uses weighted scoring instead of first-match. Technical terms score 3x, action words 1x, generic words 0x. Correctly routes "show me the API routes" to api-map instead of context.
- **8 new ask patterns**: CSS issues→css-deep, accessibility→a11y, regex→regex-audit, what changed→diff, tech stack→detect, how to configure→env-check, which files import→dependents, is this code safe→refactor-safe.
- **3 new semantic convention detectors**: CSS framework (Tailwind/Bootstrap/MUI/Chakra/Ant/Bulma), Authentication (NextAuth/Passport/JWT/OAuth/Firebase/Supabase/Clerk), Deployment (Vercel/Netlify/Docker/Fly.io/Railway/Render/Heroku/AWS/GCP).
- **Better error messages**: Command-specific error suggestions with `_suggest_fix()`. Split error handling into FileNotFoundError, ImportError, and generic Exception with helpful suggestions.
- **Consistent status field**: All commands now return `status: "ok"` (or `status: "error"` on failure). Previously some commands like `list`, `query`, `detect`, and `diff` were missing this field.

### Changed

- `codelens.py` monolith reduced from 3504 → 307 lines (modular architecture)
- Ask command accuracy: 12/12 test cases pass (was ~8/12 with first-match routing)
- Health score: percentile-based formula (clean=95, average=85, messy=55, CodeLens=5)
- Convention engine: 8 semantic detectors total (was 5)
