## [5.8.0] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Version mismatch in pyproject.toml**: Version was 5.1.0 while utils.py and skill.json said 5.7.0. Now aligned to 5.7.0.
- **CRITICAL: Broken test imports**: 5 test files (`test_css_parser`, `test_html_parser`, `test_js_backend_parser`, `test_js_frontend_parser`, `test_rust_parser`) imported fallback parsers from the old monolithic `codelens.py` which no longer exports them. Updated to import from `parsers.fallback_*` modules.
- **CRITICAL: Broken pip entry point**: Removed `codelens = "codelens:main"` from `pyproject.toml` — the scripts/ directory uses `sys.path`-based imports, not a proper Python package. Added a comment explaining what's needed to make it installable.
- **CRITICAL: Non-standard build backend**: Changed `setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend` to the standard `setuptools.build_meta`.
- **HIGH: Frontend deletion cleanup was a no-op**: When files were deleted during incremental scan, frontend class/ID entries were never cleaned because they don't have a `"defined_in"` key. Now properly filters by `"path"` in the `css`/`js`/`defined_in_html` ref lists and recomputes status.
- **HIGH: CSS parser `::` triggered SCSS fallback on standard CSS**: The `::` pattern in the SCSS/Less detection heuristic matched standard CSS3 pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`, `::placeholder`), causing duplicate class/id references. Removed `::` from the detection list.
- **HIGH: Class collision detection was broken**: HTML class definitions were mapped to the `"css"` category instead of `"html"`, so classes lost their HTML definition info. Now classes get a `"defined_in_html"` field (like IDs), enabling proper collision detection when the same class appears in multiple HTML elements.
- **HIGH: GrammarLoader was not thread-safe**: The singleton `__new__` method and dict mutations lacked locks, risking double-instantiation and data races in the watch command's threads. Added `threading.Lock` to `__new__` and a `dict_lock` for `get_language`/`get_parser`.
- **HIGH: Watch command race condition lost file changes**: Changes arriving during a rescan were lost because the debounce timer wasn't running. After scan completes, the code now checks `_changed_files` under lock and schedules another rescan if non-empty.
- **HIGH: Dead code in incremental edge processing**: `if not is_resolved and from_is_changed` in `incremental.py` was unreachable because `from_is_changed` was always False at that point (the True branch already `continue`s). Removed the dead code block.
- **MEDIUM: O(n²) BFS in impact_engine**: `queue.pop(0)` on a list is O(n), making BFS O(n²) for large call graphs. Replaced with `collections.deque` and `popleft()` for O(1).
- **MEDIUM: O(n) path.index() per back-edge in circular_engine**: Called on every cycle detection across 3 DFS functions. Added `path_index` dict for O(1) lookup.
- **MEDIUM: Search engine recompiled regex per file**: `include_pattern` and `exclude_pattern` were compiled inside the per-file loop. Now compiled once before `os.walk`.
- **MEDIUM: Dead-code command used wrong field name**: `result.get("dead_items", result.get("items", []))` didn't match the actual output key `"results"` from `deadcode_engine`. Now correctly iterates over all category lists in `results`.
- **MEDIUM: state-map markdown formatter crashed on string actions**: The `actions` list in statemap results could contain strings, but the formatter called `.get()` on them. Now handles both dicts and strings.
- **Command count updated**: pyproject.toml description now says "41 commands" (was "39").

## [5.7.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Shared DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS across 22 engines**: All engine files now import `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS` from `utils.py` instead of defining local copies with inconsistent entries. Added `.nuxt` to the shared set. Eliminated ~132 lines of duplicated configuration.

### Changed

- **Query command status consistency**: All 4 found-code-paths in `query.py` now return `status: "ok"` (was missing on 3 paths: frontend class, frontend id, backend function).
- **Comprehensive logging across 15 files**: Replaced 26 bare `except ... pass` blocks with `logger.debug()`/`logger.warning()` calls in: refactor_safe_engine, context_engine, ownership_engine, registry, testmap_engine, sideeffect_engine, deadcode_engine, circular_engine, entrypoints_engine, configdrift_engine, diff_engine, incremental, framework_detect, handbook, and watch.
- **Outline engine logging**: 5 `except Exception: pass` blocks in tree-sitter fallback functions now log at debug level.
- **Convention engine logging**: 5 `except Exception: pass` blocks in semantic detectors now log at debug level.

## [5.6.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **TSX backend extraction**: When tree-sitter-typescript is not installed, TSX files are now parsed with BOTH frontend AND backend fallback parsers. Backend nodes jumped from 124 → 764 (6.2x) on typical Next.js projects.
- **Shared utils module** (`scripts/utils.py`): Centralized `write_output_files`, `compute_summary`, `is_file_path`, `deduplicate_callers`, `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS`, `DEFAULT_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS`, `CODELENS_VERSION`, and `logger`. Eliminates 290+ lines of duplicated code across 5 files.
- **Proper logging**: Replaced 56 `except Exception: pass` blocks with `logger.warning()`/`logger.debug()` calls. Errors are now visible when they occur instead of being silently swallowed.
- **Fuzzy file path lookup**: `context layout.tsx` and `query layout.tsx` now match partial paths (end-of-path matching). Previously required exact path like `apps/web/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`. Returns grouped results when multiple files match.
- **Auto-incremental scan with registry counts**: When no changes detected, the response now includes actual backend/frontend counts instead of zeros.
- **Handbook registry freshness check**: Handbook skips re-scan if `backend.json` is less than 5 minutes old. Reduces handbook execution time from 2.8s → 0.3s for consecutive runs.

### Changed

- **is_frontend_file / is_backend_file**: Now uses path segment matching instead of substring matching. `"src/"` no longer falsely matches `src/server/api/auth.ts` as a frontend file.
- **_detect_workspace depth limit**: Walks up at most 10 directory levels (was unlimited). Prevents matching a `.git` directory many levels up.
- **Incremental scan with deleted files**: Instead of falling back to full rescan, deleted files are selectively removed from the registry. Preserves incremental scan performance.
- **god_objects Python scoping**: Method count is now scoped to each class using indentation analysis (was counting ALL `def` in the file).
- **Consistent status field**: `context` and `query` file-path responses now include `status: "ok"` (was missing).
- **Context multi-file response**: New `type: "files"` response format when multiple files match a partial path query, with markdown formatting support.
- **Handbook version**: Now uses `CODELENS_VERSION` constant from `utils.py` (was hardcoded as `"5.2.0"`).

### Fixed

- **TSX files produced zero backend nodes**: When TSXParser failed to import, only CSS class/ID data was extracted. Now uses `parse_js_backend_fallback` on TSX files too.
- **Auto-incremental returned zero counts**: "No changes detected" response had `backend.nodes: 0, backend.edges: 0` even when registry had thousands of entries.
- **Handbook version stale**: Was hardcoded as 5.2.0 in output, now dynamically reads from `CODELENS_VERSION`.

## [5.5.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Auto-incremental scan**: Scan now automatically uses incremental mode when a registry already exists (`.codelens/backend.json` present). No need to pass `--incremental` flag. First scan is always full; subsequent scans auto-detect changes.
- **oRPC route detection**: API-map now detects oRPC-style routers (`.procedure()`, `router({})`, `protectedProcedure`/`adminProcedure` chains). Detects 67 routes in typical oRPC projects (was 2).
- **tRPC v10+ detection**: Improved tRPC extraction with `t.procedure`, `publicProcedure.query/mutation`, `initTRPC`, and router body parsing for named procedure paths.
- **Context by file path**: `context src/lib/auth.ts` now returns all symbols defined in that file, not just symbol-name lookups.
- **Query by file path**: `query src/lib/auth.ts` returns all symbols in the file, grouped by file.
- **bun.lock support**: Vulnerability scanner now parses Bun's text-based `bun.lock` format for dependency checking.
- **Next.js destructured route exports**: API-map now detects `export const { GET, POST } = handler()` and `export const GET = ...` patterns in Next.js App Router.

### Changed

- **Health score calibration**: Deep nesting now reports per-block instead of per-line (was 6419 findings → 300). Magic values skip config/test/fixture files and JSX style props. Weighted density formula (`critical*3 + warning + info*0.1`) prevents info-level smells from tanking scores. Typical React project health: 90 (was 25).
- **Deep nesting thresholds**: Raised from 4→5 (warning) and 6→8 (critical) to account for natural React component nesting.
- **Duplicate caller filtering**: `query` and `context` commands now deduplicate callers by (file, line) tuple.

### Fixed

- **Secrets markdown truncation**: Severity "high" was truncated to "igh]" in markdown output due to f-string variable name collision. Now displays correctly as `[HIGH]`, `[CRITICAL]`, etc.

## [5.4.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **True incremental scan**: Partial registry merge — changed files' entries are updated in-place instead of rebuilding the entire registry. Unchanged files' data is preserved, making `--incremental` significantly faster for large codebases.
- **Complete markdown formatters**: All 41 commands now have specific markdown formatters (was 15/41). No command falls through to generic formatting anymore.
- **Score-based ask routing**: Natural language query router now uses weighted scoring instead of first-match. Technical terms score 3x, action words 1x, generic words 0x. Correctly routes "show me the API routes" to api-map instead of context.
- **8 new ask patterns**: CSS issues→css-deep, accessibility→a11y, regex→regex-audit, what changed→diff, tech stack→detect, how to configure→env-check, which files import→dependents, is this code safe→refactor-safe.
- **3 new semantic convention detectors**: CSS framework (Tailwind/Bootstrap/MUI/Chakra/Ant/Bulma), Authentication (NextAuth/Passport/JWT/OAuth/Firebase/Supabase/Clerk), Deployment (Vercel/Netlify/Docker/Fly.io/Railway/Render/Heroku/AWS/GCP).
- **Better error messages**: Command-specific error suggestions with `_suggest_fix()`. Split error handling into FileNotFoundError, ImportError, and generic Exception with helpful suggestions.
- **Consistent status field**: All commands now return `status: "ok"` (or `status: "error"` on failure). Previously some commands like `list`, `query`, `detect`, and `diff` were missing this field.

### Changed

- `codelens.py` monolith reduced from 3504 → 307 lines (modular architecture)
- Ask command accuracy: 12/12 test cases pass (was ~8/12 with first-match routing)
- Health score: percentile-based formula (clean=95, average=85, messy=55, CodeLens=5)
- Convention engine: 8 semantic detectors total (was 5)
